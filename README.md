# Parallel Query Processing in PostgreSQL

This repository contains code and resources related to parallel query processing in PostgreSQL. It includes Jupyter notebooks for adding dummy data to the database (`add_data.ipynb`), executing and comparing normal and parallel SQL queries (`main.ipynb`), and a requirements.txt file listing all required libraries. Additionally, a PDF document (`Theory.pdf`) explaining the theoretical background and implementation details of parallel computing in database query processing is provided.

## Files:

- **add_data.ipynb**: Jupyter notebook to add dummy data to the PostgreSQL database.
- **main.ipynb**: Jupyter notebook to execute and compare normal and parallel SQL queries.

## Usage:

1\. **Add Dummy Data**: Use `add_data.ipynb` to add dummy data to your PostgreSQL database. Modify the connection parameters and the number of rows as needed before executing the notebook.

2\. **Execute and Compare Queries**: Run `main.ipynb` to execute and compare normal and parallel SQL queries. Adjust the connection parameters and SQL queries as required.

3\. **Installation**: Before running the notebooks, make sure to install all required libraries listed in `requirements.txt`. You can install them using pip:

    ```bash

    pip install -r requirements.txt

    ```
